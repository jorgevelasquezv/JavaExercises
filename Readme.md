# Java Quadratic Equation Solver

This repository contains a Java program that solves quadratic equations. ax2 + bx + c = 0

## Description

The program takes three coefficients of a quadratic equation as input, calculates the discriminant, and then finds the roots of the equation. It uses the Java `Math.sqrt()` function to calculate the square root of the discriminant.

## Usage

To run the program, compile the `SolveQuadraticEquation.java` file and then run the resulting class file:

```bash
javac SolveQuadraticEquation.java
java SolveQuadraticEquation
